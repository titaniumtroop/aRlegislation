Description: A dataset of legislation for natural language primarily for 
    processing and graph analysis. Legislative sessions are nested by cycle and 
    session type. Each cycle/session contains three separate data frames: acts 
    (legislative text), lawmakers (metadata including political party), and 
    sponsorship (links the other two data frames).
